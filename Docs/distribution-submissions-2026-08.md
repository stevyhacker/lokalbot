## 1. Uneed.best

Form: https://www.uneed.best/submit-a-tool — note their flow scrapes the link you give it first, then asks you to sign up to save and complete the listing. Paste these values over/into whatever the scrape pre-fills.

| Field | Value to paste |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `LokalBot` |
| Tagline (<=60 chars) | `A local LLM that remembers your workday. Private, on-device.` |
| Link | `https://github.com/stevyhacker/lokalbot` |
| Pricing | `Free / Open source` |
| Topics / categories | `Artificial Intelligence`, `Productivity`, `Developer Tools` |

**Description (~2 paragraphs, maker voice):**

```text
LokalBot is a local-first AI workspace for macOS that records, transcribes,
and summarizes your meetings entirely on your machine. It captures both
sides of every call with a Core Audio process tap — your mic is "Me", the
meeting app's audio is "Them" — so there is no bot joining your calls and
nothing leaving your device. Transcription runs locally too: IBM Granite
Speech by default, Parakeet when you want ~190x realtime, Whisper when you
need 99 languages, Qwen3-ASR as another engine. Summaries and chat answers
cite the transcript, so you can trust (and check) every claim.

Beyond meetings, LokalBot gives you Dictation (hold Option-Space anywhere),
Cotyping ghost-text autocomplete in any app, and a day Timeline of what you
worked on. Developers get lokalbot-cli: a read-only CLI plus a stdio MCP
server, shipped as a one-click .mcpb bundle, so your agent can answer
"what did we decide last Tuesday?" without ever seeing the cloud — because
there is no LokalBot cloud. GPLv3, Apple Silicon M1+, macOS 15.0+, signed,
notarized, Sparkle updates.
```

Upload order suggestion: hero.gif first (thumbnail), then feature-demo.mp4, then the five strongest screens.

**Maker comment draft (post as the first comment right after launch goes live):**

```text
Hey! I built LokalBot because I wanted meeting notes that never leave my
Mac. Two things I'm proudest of: the two-track capture — one process tap,
both sides of the call, zero bots in your calendar invites — and citations
on every summary, so the AI has to show its work against the real
transcript. Everything runs on-device (Granite Speech / Parakeet /
Whisper), and if you're a terminal person, lokalbot-cli + its MCP server
let your coding agent query your own meeting history locally. Happy to
answer anything about the architecture or the models.
```

**Launch-day note:** Uneed runs launches through a daily queue; a paid fast-track exists to skip it. Decide before launch day whether to take the free slot (pick a date you can be online all day replying) or pay for fast-track positioning. Either way: post the maker comment immediately when the listing flips live, and answer every question within the day — Uneed's audience rewards engaged makers.

## 2. Console.dev

Console.dev is editorial: there is no form — they ask you to **email hello@console.dev** with the details (verified on their selection-criteria page). The newsletter ships **every Thursday** and features 2–3 tools per issue, so send Monday–Tuesday to land in that week's curation window. Their criteria favor tools where the primary user is a developer, with a CLI, self-service install, good docs, active maintenance, and no privacy downsides — all of which play to LokalBot.

**Pitch email — To:** `hello@console.dev`

**Subject:** `LokalBot — local-first meeting memory with a read-only CLI and MCP server (GPLv3)`

```text
Hi Console team,

LokalBot is a local-first AI workspace for macOS (Apple Silicon M1+,
macOS 15.0+, GPLv3) that keeps a private memory of your workday: it
records and transcribes meetings entirely on-device using a Core Audio
process tap — mic for "Me", the meeting app's tap for "Them" — so no bot
ever joins the call and no audio leaves the machine. Transcription engines
are swappable local models: IBM Granite Speech 4.1 by default, Parakeet at
roughly 190x realtime, Whisper for 99 languages, Qwen3-ASR. BYO GGUF via
Ollama works too. Summaries and chat cite the transcript line they came
from.

Why I think it fits Console: the developer story isn't the GUI — it's
lokalbot-cli, a read-only CLI (list / search / get) plus a stdio MCP
server, also shipped as a one-click LokalBot.mcpb bundle, so an agent in
your editor can answer questions about yesterday's meetings locally. You
can build from source; releases are Developer ID signed, notarized, and
stapled with Sparkle updates.

- Site: https://www.lokalbot.com
- CLI skill docs: https://github.com/stevyhacker/lokalbot/blob/main/.agents/skills/lokalbot-cli/SKILL.md

Latest release is v0.6.2 (pre-1.0, so eligible for your betas section as
well). Happy to answer anything.

Best,
<name>
```

Before sending: replace `<name>`, skim the current week's issue (https://console.dev) so the reply-to thread references something real, and send Mon/Tue for the Thursday cadence.

## 3. DevHunt

Site: https://devhunt.org — sign in with GitHub, then "Submit your tool"; launches are scheduled into daily slots and voted up by comments.

| Field | Value to paste |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `LokalBot` |
| Tagline | `Local meeting notes, private workday memory` |
| One-liner | `A local LLM workhorse that keeps a private memory of your workday.` |
| Link | `https://github.com/stevyhacker/lokalbot` |
| Topics | `AI`, `Productivity`, `Developer Tools`, `Privacy` |

**Description:**

```text
LokalBot records, transcribes, and summarizes your meetings entirely
on-device on macOS (Apple Silicon M1+, macOS 15.0+, GPLv3). Capture is
bot-free: a Core Audio process tap grabs both tracks — your mic is "Me",
the meeting app is "Them". Transcription is local (IBM Granite Speech 4.1
default, Parakeet ~190x realtime, Whisper 99 languages, Qwen3-ASR), and
summaries/chat always cite the transcript.

For developers: lokalbot-cli is a read-only CLI and stdio MCP server
(one-click LokalBot.mcpb bundle), so your agent can query your meeting
history locally. Also includes Dictation (hold Option-Space), Cotyping
ghost-text autocomplete in any app, and a day Timeline. No account, no
telemetry, no LokalBot cloud. Signed, notarized, Sparkle updates.
```

**Gallery asset paths (verified in-repo):**

- `Assets/screenshots/meetings-transcript.png`
- `Assets/screenshots/dictation.png`
- `Assets/screenshots/cotyping.png`
- Video (if a video field is offered): `web/assets/feature-demo.mp4`

**Launch-day comment draft (post as maker first thing on launch day):**

```text
Maker here. The idea: your meetings are already on your machine — the
notes should be too. LokalBot taps both audio tracks locally (no bot in
your calls), transcribes with local models, and cites every summary
against the transcript. Terminal folks: lokalbot-cli speaks JSON by
default, has --table, and doubles as a stdio MCP server, so Claude Code or
any MCP client can ask "what did we decide on Tuesday?" without a single
byte leaving your Mac. GPLv3, M1+, macOS 15+. Ask me anything.
```

## 4. Skill registries

Two real registries exist today; both were verified on 2026-08-21. The in-repo skill is `.agents/skills/lokalbot-cli/SKILL.md`; the Claude Code plugin manifests are `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

### 4a. skills.sh (Vercel)

Verified: **skills.sh has no submission form and takes no PRs.** It is a leaderboard auto-indexing public GitHub repos whose skills get installed through the open-source `skills` CLI (`npx skills add <owner/repo>`); rankings come from anonymous install telemetry. Your skill appears once people install it from your repo.

Submission step (≈5 minutes):

1. Confirm `.agents/skills/lokalbot-cli/SKILL.md` has valid frontmatter (`name:` + `description:`) — it does (verified: `name: lokalbot-cli`).
2. Verify discoverability once by running:
   ```
   npx skills add stevyhacker/lokalbot
   ```
   and confirm `lokalbot-cli` is offered/installed.
3. Add the official install-count badge to the README (this is the Registries agent's one allowed README edit — coordinate):
   ```markdown
   [![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/stevyhacker/lokalbot)](https://skills.sh/stevyhacker/lokalbot)
   ```
4. Seed discovery: share the one-line install command wherever LokalBot is announced — installs are what rank the skill.

Ready promo text (paste anywhere skills are discussed):

```text
Give your coding agent a private memory of your workday:

npx skills add stevyhacker/lokalbot

The lokalbot-cli skill teaches Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and friends to
query your on-device LokalBot meeting library — list, search, get with
citations — over a read-only CLI and stdio MCP server. Nothing leaves your
Mac. Works with any agent that reads SKILL.md files.
```

### 4b. Anthropic community plugin directory (Claude Code / Cowork)

Verified: the directory lives at `anthropics/claude-plugins-community` (read-only mirror synced nightly from Anthropic's review pipeline after automated security scanning). **PRs opened directly against the repo are closed automatically** — the only real submission path is the web form at **https://clau.de/plugin-directory-submission**.

Submission step (≈15 minutes):

1. Wait until `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exist on `main` (added in this batch by the sibling agent) and are pushed to GitHub — the form will ask for the repo/source.
2. Open https://clau.de/plugin-directory-submission and fill it in with the values below.
3. Expect automated security scanning, then nightly sync into the marketplace. After approval, users install with:
   ```
   claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-community
   claude plugin install <plugin-name>@claude-community
   ```

Ready submission text (adapt to whatever free-text fields the form offers):

```text
Plugin: lokalbot (source: github.com/stevyhacker/lokalbot)

What it does: connects Claude Code and Claude Cowork to LokalBot, a
local-first macOS workspace that records, transcribes, and summarizes
meetings entirely on-device. Through the bundled read-only lokalbot-cli
and its stdio MCP server, the plugin lets Claude list, search, and quote
past meetings with transcript citations — locally, with nothing sent to
any external service. MCP tool access is gated behind explicit in-app
consent toggles.

Manifests: .claude-plugin/plugin.json and .claude-plugin/marketplace.json
in the repo root define the plugin and its marketplace entry.

Skill: the plugin wraps .agents/skills/lokalbot-cli/SKILL.md, which
documents list/search/get/path verbs, JSON output, and a hard rule never
to send meeting content to external services.

Facts for reviewers: GPLv3; Apple Silicon M1+; macOS 15.0+; no account,
no telemetry, no vendor cloud; Developer ID signed, notarized, stapled;
Sparkle updates; latest release v0.6.2 (2026-08-20).
```

### Non-registries checked and ruled out

- **skills.sh**: no manual submissions possible — covered above via install-driven indexing.
- **anthropics/claude-plugins-community**: PRs auto-closed; form-only — covered above.
- No other Anthropic-operated skill/plugin directory accepts third-party listings as of 2026-08-21.
