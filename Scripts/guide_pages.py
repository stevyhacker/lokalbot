        <h2>What “local” should mean</h2>
        <p>A meeting-notes app can store a copy on your laptop and still upload the audio for transcription. A genuinely local-first workflow keeps the recording, speech recognition, recap generation, and searchable library on the computer by default. Network access may still be needed to download the app, fetch a model, and check for updates. If you deliberately configure a remote inference server, that server receives the context needed for the request.</p>
        <p>LokalBot follows that narrower, testable definition. It has no account, telemetry backend, or LokalBot-hosted AI service. Its built-in speech and language models run on Apple Silicon, while meetings, transcripts, summaries, and search indexes live in the app's local data directory.</p>

        <h2>From call to recap</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Capture two sources.</strong> Your microphone is recorded as “Me.” A macOS Core Audio process tap captures the meeting application's output as “Them.” No participant bot needs to join.</li>
          <li><strong>Transcribe on-device.</strong> Choose Granite Speech, Parakeet, Qwen3-ASR, or Whisper. The audio stays on the Mac while the selected engine creates a timestamped transcript.</li>
          <li><strong>Write the recap.</strong> A built-in llama.cpp model can produce the summary, decisions, and action items locally. You can instead select Ollama, Apple Intelligence, or an explicitly approved OpenAI-compatible origin.</li>
          <li><strong>Search and replay.</strong> The transcript and recap are indexed in the local library. A search result can take you back to the relevant point in the recording.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why two audio tracks matter</h2>
        <p>Recording the microphone and meeting app separately provides a useful speaker boundary before any diarization model runs. It distinguishes you from the rest of the call, keeps the two sources synchronized, and avoids the audible joins and calendar invitations created by meeting bots. Optional neural diarization can split the remote track further when several other people speak.</p>

        <h2>The honest trade-offs</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> LokalBot requires an Apple Silicon Mac running macOS 15 or later.</li>
          <li><strong>Storage:</strong> selected models download before first use. Small choices start around 0.5 GB; high-quality language models can be much larger.</li>
          <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> microphone and system-audio access are necessary for capture. Other features ask separately for Calendar, Accessibility, or Screen Recording access.</li>
          <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> bot-free is not consent-free. You must follow the recording laws and policies that apply to the people in your meeting.</li>
          <li><strong>Model quality:</strong> local accuracy depends on language, acoustics, model choice, and available memory. Keeping more than one speech model installed lets you switch for difficult recordings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who benefits most</h2>
        <p>Local meeting notes are a strong fit for confidential client work, engineering discussions, research interviews, financial conversations, or anyone who simply does not want a permanent vendor account attached to every conversation. They are less compelling when a team primarily needs shared cloud workspaces, centralized administration, or mobile capture across several platforms.</p>

        <h2>Prepare before you go offline</h2>
        <p>Offline transcription is simple once every required file is already on the Mac. Install LokalBot, open its model settings, and download at least one speech-recognition model. Process a short test recording while connected so macOS permissions, the model, and the output folder are all confirmed before the real meeting.</p>
        <p>The app itself does not require an account or activation server. Once the selected files are present, recording, transcription, local summarization, search, and playback can run without internet access.</p>

        <h2>Choose the speech engine for the job</h2>
        <p>There is no universal best local model. LokalBot exposes several engines because language coverage, speed, timestamps, and hard-audio accuracy pull in different directions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>IBM Granite Speech 4.1 2B</strong> is the recommended high-accuracy default.</li>
          <li><strong>Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3</strong> is the fast multilingual option, covering 25 languages and measuring around 190× realtime in the project's benchmark.</li>
          <li><strong>Parakeet v2</strong> focuses on English and can be useful when recall matters more than broad language coverage.</li>
          <li><strong>Qwen3-ASR 1.7B</strong> covers 52 languages and dialects and is the heavier Qwen tier for difficult recordings; its download is about 3.2 GB.</li>
          <li><strong>Qwen3-ASR 0.6B</strong> provides a compact global-coverage option at roughly 0.7 GB.</li>
          <li><strong>Whisper large-v3 turbo</strong> covers 99 languages, supports word timestamps, and is a useful wide-language fallback at roughly 1.6 GB.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What happens during an offline meeting</h2>
        <p>LokalBot writes your microphone and the meeting application's output to synchronized local tracks. When the meeting ends, the chosen speech engine turns those files into text on the Mac. The built-in language-model backend can then write a recap without a server request. The transcript, recap, audio references, and search index remain in the local library.</p>
        <p>Offline mode does not weaken recording-consent requirements. The app starts with manual recording as the default, and optional detection modes still leave the decision and legal responsibility with you.</p>

        <h2>What still uses the network</h2>
        <p>Model files and application updates have to come from somewhere, so those downloads require a connection. Optional Agent Mode setup also downloads its pinned runtime. Finally, if you replace the built-in inference backend with a non-loopback OpenAI-compatible URL, that configured service naturally needs the network and receives the request context. Loopback services such as a local Ollama instance can remain entirely on the Mac.</p>

        <h2>A useful offline checklist</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Download the speech model and one summarization model.</li>
          <li>Record and process a 30-second test with the meeting app you will use.</li>
          <li>Confirm both “Me” and “Them” tracks contain audio.</li>
          <li>Disconnect Wi-Fi and repeat the test.</li>
          <li>Keep enough free disk space for the models and meeting audio.</li>

        "read_time": "6 min read",
        "body": """
        <h2>Open source is evidence, not a magic label</h2>
        <p>Source access lets you inspect what a meeting app records, where it stores the result, which hosts it contacts, and what changes when you enable an optional service. It does not automatically prove that a particular downloadable build matches the repository, or that every dependency is harmless. Treat the code as an unusually strong verification tool, then check the actual release and runtime behavior too.</p>

        <h2>Start with the license</h2>
        <p>LokalBot is released under GPLv3. You can read, modify, and build the code, and distributed derivative versions must preserve the license obligations. That differs from “source available” products whose licenses restrict commercial use, redistribution, or forks. The repository's license file is the authoritative text.</p>

        <h2>Trace the meeting data path</h2>
        <p>For a private notetaker, follow the recording from capture to deletion:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The microphone and selected meeting process produce two local audio tracks.</li>
          <li>A downloaded speech engine creates the transcript on Apple Silicon.</li>
          <li>The built-in llama.cpp backend can generate a summary locally.</li>
          <li>SQLite stores the library and full-text search index.</li>
          <li>Fresh installs select encrypted visual context by default; capture remains permission-gated, encrypted at rest, and deleted after 14 days by default.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Then identify the exceptions. LokalBot connects to download models and updates, to set up optional Agent Mode, and to call any non-loopback inference origin you explicitly approve. That distinction is more useful than an absolute “never connects” claim.</p>

        <h2>Check account and telemetry requirements</h2>
        <p>An app can be open source while its useful features depend on a hosted account. LokalBot has no account, subscription, analytics service, advertising SDK, or telemetry backend. Its public issue tracker provides community support, and the security policy points vulnerability reports to a private channel.</p>

        <h2>Build it yourself</h2>
        <p>The repository includes an XcodeGen project manifest and build instructions. A source build is the strongest way to connect the code you inspected with the binary you run. It also makes the trade-off explicit: local-first software still relies on macOS frameworks and bundled or downloaded model runtimes, so dependency review remains part of a serious audit.</p>

        "read_time": "5 min read",
        "body": """
        <h2>Why ordinary recording falls short</h2>
        <p>Your microphone is designed to capture your voice, not clean digital output from Zoom, Teams, Meet, Slack, Webex, or FaceTime. Turning the speakers up and recording the room mixes both sides with echo, keyboard noise, and acoustic processing. A cloud meeting bot avoids that acoustic problem but becomes another participant, may require calendar access, and sends the call through an external service.</p>

        <h2>The two-track approach</h2>
        <p>LokalBot records the microphone as the “Me” track. At the same time, a Core Audio process tap records the selected meeting application's output as “Them.” The tracks are kept synchronized and processed on the Mac. This gives the transcript an immediate speaker boundary without relying on a bot or trying to infer whether every sentence came from you.</p>
        <p>When multiple remote participants speak, optional on-device diarization can divide the “Them” side into additional speakers. Diarization is probabilistic, so names and boundaries may still need editing after a difficult or overlapping conversation.</p>

        <h2>What the other participants see</h2>
        <p>No account joins the room, no virtual participant appears in the roster, and no bot announces itself. That makes the workflow less disruptive, but it does not make recording invisible in a legal or ethical sense. Tell people when required, obtain consent, and follow employer and platform policies. LokalBot is a personal recorder; it cannot decide whether a particular meeting may be recorded.</p>

        <h2>Permissions and controls</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Microphone access</strong> captures your side.</li>
          <li><strong>System-audio access</strong> enables the process tap for the other side.</li>
          <li><strong>Manual recording</strong> is the fresh-install default.</li>
          <li><strong>Ask-first or automatic modes</strong> can react to supported meeting apps after you enable them.</li>
          <li><strong>Calendar access</strong> is optional and can help detect and title scheduled meetings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>After the call</h2>
        <p>The selected local speech model transcribes the synchronized audio. The built-in language model can turn the transcript into a TL;DR, decisions, and action items. Because the capture sources are separate, you can replay the meeting with a clearer “Me” versus “Them” context and search from a result back to the relevant timestamp.</p>

        <h2>A pre-meeting test worth doing</h2>
        <p>Open the actual meeting app, play remote audio, speak into your microphone, and make a short recording. Verify that both tracks show activity and play back correctly. macOS permissions and device routing can change when you switch headsets, docks, or output devices, so repeat this check before an unusually important call.</p>

        <h2>There is no single best speech model</h2>

          <li><strong>Choose Parakeet v3</strong> when throughput and its 25 supported languages cover your meetings.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep Whisper installed</strong> if you need broader language coverage or word timestamps.</li>
          <li><strong>Try Qwen3-ASR 1.7B</strong> on difficult multilingual recordings where the compact engines miss too much.</li>
          <li><strong>Compare on your audio.</strong> A two-minute representative clip is more informative than a generic benchmark.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Speech recognition is only one stage</h2>
        <p>Speaker separation, punctuation, summary quality, and action-item extraction depend on later stages too. LokalBot begins with separate “Me” and “Them” capture tracks, can apply on-device diarization to the remote side, and then sends the transcript to the selected summarization backend. A perfect language model cannot recover words that the speech model never recognized, so improve capture and transcription before tuning recap prompts.</p>

        <h2>Storage and memory planning</h2>
        <p>Speech models are not the only downloads. Local summary and cotyping models range from about 0.53 GB to roughly 17.73 GB in the built-in catalog. Smaller options work on any supported Apple Silicon Mac; several quality-focused choices recommend 16 GB, while the largest long-meeting defaults target 32 GB or more. Install only what you use and keep free space for recordings.</p>

        <h2>How to evaluate output</h2>
        <ul>

        <h2>Required hardware and software</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mac:</strong> Apple Silicon — M1 or later.</li>
          <li><strong>Operating system:</strong> macOS 15.0 or later.</li>
          <li><strong>Disk:</strong> room for the app, recordings, and selected models.</li>
          <li><strong>Internet:</strong> required for the initial app and model downloads; optional for the built-in workflow after setup.</li>

        <p>Intel Macs are not supported. LokalBot is built around Apple Silicon acceleration, Core Audio process taps, the Neural Engine, MLX, and Metal rather than treating macOS as one target among many.</p>

        <h2>How much memory do you need?</h2>
        <p>The application runs across the supported Apple Silicon range, but local language-model choice changes the practical memory requirement. Compact built-in models start around 0.53–1.28 GB. Several balanced summary and cotyping models recommend 16 GB of unified memory. The largest long-meeting models in the catalog are roughly 16.8–17.73 GB on disk and target Macs with 32 GB or more.</p>
        <p>You do not need the largest model to record or transcribe a meeting. Choose a compact speech model and a smaller summarizer first, then move up only if the quality gain is worthwhile on your hardware.</p>

        <h2>Plan disk space by workflow</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Compact setup:</strong> a roughly 0.7 GB Qwen3-ASR speech model plus a small 0.53–1.28 GB language model.</li>
          <li><strong>Broader transcription:</strong> Whisper large-v3 turbo is roughly 1.6 GB; Qwen3-ASR 1.7B is roughly 3.2 GB.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality-focused summaries:</strong> larger catalog choices add about 5–18 GB each.</li>
          <li><strong>Meetings and day memory:</strong> audio, transcripts, and visual captures use additional space over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These numbers describe model downloads and may change when publishers update packaging. LokalBot lets you choose rather than downloading every model.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Microphone</strong> records your voice.</li>
