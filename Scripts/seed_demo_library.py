"""Plant a self-contained demo meeting library for screenshots / manual QA.

Mirrors StorageManager's on-disk layout (the same shape the Swift UI-test
fixture writes) so the app indexes it on launch. Dates are anchored to *now*
so the meeting list always reads TODAY / YESTERDAY, and the library spans
three weeks so search, chat, and the meeting list look lived-in.

Also seeds:
  - chats/<uuid>.json    plaintext conversations (ChatStore loads and migrates
                         them to .enc) — the latest one shows an answered
                         question with [meeting:ID@M:SS] citation markers
  - activity_blocks      several weekdays of day-timeline data

Usage:
    python3 Scripts/seed_demo_library.py <storage-root>

Point the app at <storage-root> via LOKALBOT_STORAGE_ROOT. See
Scripts/capture-screenshots.sh for the full capture flow.
