/// reproduces the meeting; click-to-seek from the transcript lands here.
///
/// Each track gets its own `AVAudioPlayer` and the OS mixes them at the output
/// device. This is deliberate: the mic and system files routinely differ in
/// sample rate (device-native vs. the 48 kHz tap) and channel count (mono vs.
/// stereo mixdown). Folding both into one `AVMutableComposition` + `AVAudioMix`
/// and rendering through `AVPlayer` garbles the mismatched track during
/// real-time playback — independent players resample each cleanly. (Offline
/// export can still use the composition; see `MeetingAudioAsset`.)
