# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes are made for the latest published LokalBot release. Upgrade to
the newest release before reporting a problem that may already be fixed.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please use GitHub's private vulnerability-reporting form:

https://github.com/stevyhacker/lokalbot/security/advisories/new

Include affected versions, impact, reproduction steps, and a minimal proof of
concept. Do not include real meeting data or credentials. If private reporting
is unavailable, open a public issue containing no exploit details and ask for a
private contact channel.

Please allow a reasonable remediation window before public disclosure. You can
expect an acknowledgement when the report is read, an initial severity
assessment, and coordinated release notes for a confirmed fix.

## Security boundaries

- LokalBot is not sandboxed because macOS system-audio capture and its optional
  Accessibility features require capabilities that do not work in the App
  Sandbox.
- Remote inference is optional. Approving a non-loopback endpoint permits it to
  receive the context needed for the requested feature.
- Agent Mode commands execute only after the configured approval policy allows
  them, but approved commands run with the current macOS user's permissions.
- The external-agent CLI/MCP surface is read-only and gated by the Agent Access
  setting; enabling it grants trusted local processes access to the library.
