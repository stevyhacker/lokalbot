# LokalBot hero demo production

This HyperFrames project renders the narrated product films used on the website
and in the repository README. It deliberately keeps generated screenshot copies,
audio stems, review renders, and local tool environments out of Git: the source
captures remain canonical under `Assets/screenshots/`.

Both productions are 1872×1276 at 30 fps so they map exactly to the website's
936×638 display slot at 2× density:

- The 30-second production is the default `web/assets/hero-demo.mp4` and is also
  preserved as `hero-demo-short.mp4`. It focuses on Quick Recall, Context Rewind,
  Dictation, Cotyping, and the local-first privacy payoff.
- The 56-second production is preserved as `hero-demo-long.mp4`. It adds the
  meeting recap, transcript evidence, and cited answers.

`DESIGN.md` defines the visual and motion language; `storyboard.md` locks the
long-form narrative and claim boundaries.

Run the repository-level pipeline:

```sh
Scripts/render-hero-video-short.sh
```

The short render refreshes both the named short file and the canonical default.
Render the extended cut separately with `Scripts/render-hero-video.sh`.

If the script or narration is stale, provide an ElevenLabs key in the process
environment. The key is used in memory and is never written to the project:

```sh
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=... Scripts/render-hero-video-short.sh
```

For iteration inside this folder:

```sh
./prepare_assets.sh
npm run check
npm run render -- --output renders/lokalbot-hero-demo.mp4 --fps 30 --quality high
```

The short/default production uses Eleven v3 with the young male Will narration
voice in Natural mode at its native 1.0× speed. The preserved long cut uses the
original ElevenLabs Multilingual v2/Bella performance. Neither production uses
time stretching or an editorial speed-up. The original score and UI effects are
synthesized by `generate_audio.py`. The final video contains narration, an
ambient music bed, UI sound design, and burned-in captions aligned to
ElevenLabs character timings. The short delivery remuxes the HyperFrames master
video stream directly, avoiding a second lossy pass over small interface text.
