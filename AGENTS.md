# LokalBot

LokalBot is a private work-memory app for macOS. Meetings are one input. Preserve local processing defaults, capture exclusions, retention behavior, and separate consent boundaries for meeting-library access, screen memory, remote inference origins, and Agent Mode actions. [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) defines the data and network contract.

## Working agreements

- Complete the requested scope through relevant verification and correction of failures caused by the change. Reuse authorization already given; ask when a material decision or action exceeds that scope. Keep reviews and audits read-only unless implementation is requested.
- Preserve unrelated work. When committing is authorized, stage only task files. Publication, releases, and production changes require authorization covering those actions.
- Run checks relevant to the change and required by the repository. Repeat or broaden them when new changes, failures, or unresolved risks justify it. Documentation-only edits need link and diff checks, not an app build.
- Never run UI tests locally on this MacBook. Use hosted CI or a remote runner; `Scripts/ui-tests.sh --remote` is the explicit remote entry point. Local compilation and non-UI tests are allowed. Verify the tested revision includes the requested changes.
- When asked to reinstall the installed app, use `Scripts/reinstall-preserve-permissions.sh`. Preserve its identity and permissions; do not use a delete-first installation.
- `project.yml` owns the generated Xcode project. Run `xcodegen generate` after changing project configuration or adding/removing source files. Preserve dependency pins unless the task calls for an update or a verified incompatibility blocks it.

## References by task

Read the relevant sections when the task touches them:

- Build, schemes, CLI packaging, runtime, or tests: [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).
- Capture, retention, or data leaving the Mac: [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).
- Signing, release artifacts, or publication: [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).
- Website changes: [web/CLAUDE.md](web/CLAUDE.md).
- Video work: [Video/AGENTS.md](Video/AGENTS.md) and the selected project's guide.
- Retrieving recorded work through the CLI or MCP: [.agents/skills/lokalbot-cli/SKILL.md](.agents/skills/lokalbot-cli/SKILL.md).

Report whether the requested result was built, tested, installed, or released, with any concrete blocker and remaining work. A successful build or CI run alone does not establish installation or release completion.
